## End Notes ðŸ“‘
In this project, I have tried to achieve a near-to-perfect clone of the original website images provided as much as possible. This entire journey of this construct week has given us experiences and we have learned lots of things by applying to the actual website and it gave us a lot of confidence. Most of the features are added and the functionality of the website is achieved.
